        <p>
          Hi I'm Ryan Boddy. I am a full time DevOps engineer and a
          freelance/hobbyist Web Developer. I am married to my best friend
          Baylee and we are expecting our first son in July of 2019. I cannot
          wait to meet the little guy! If I'm not writing code or hanging with
          my wife you can find me playing video games with my friends. I
          attended Florida Gulf Coast University (Go Eagles!) where I earned my
          bachelors in Computer Imformation Systems. I have been writing code
          for close to 10 years now, and I'm still learning something new every
          day. I love to spend my time exploring topics relating to web
          development.
