              Hi I'm Ryan Boddy. I am a full time DevOps engineer and a
              freelance/hobbyist Web Developer. I am married to my best friend
              Baylee and we are expecting our first son in July of 2019. I
              cannot wait to meet the little guy! If I'm not writing code or
              hanging with my wife you can find me playing video games with my
              friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              I attended Florida Gulf Coast University (Go Eagles!) where I
              earned my bachelors in Computer Imformation Systems. I have been
              writing code for close to 10 years now, and I'm still learning
              something new every day. I love to spend my time exploring topics
              relating to web development.
